# AutoQuiz

## Elevator Pitch
A Chrome extension and web app that generates quizzes based on webpage content. Users can click the extension button to generate quizzes from articles or YouTube captions, and view or take quizzes in the web app.

## About the Project

### Inspiration
The AutoQuiz project was inspired by the idea of making learning interactive by generating quizzes from any webpage content. We wanted to make a fun and educational tool that could turn any online reading experience into a quiz session.

### What We Learned
Throughout the hackathon, we learned about full-stack development, working with APIs, and integrating a Chrome extension with a backend server. We also tackled challenges related to managing frontend-backend communication and handling asynchronous processes.

### How It Was Built
AutoQuiz is built using the following technologies:
- **Chrome Extension**: Extracts content from webpages (articles, blog posts, YouTube captions) and generates quizzes.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express and PostgreSQL for managing and generating quizzes.
- **Frontend**: React and TypeScript for building a user-friendly interface.

### Challenges
- Setting up communication between the Chrome extension and the backend.
- Configuring TypeScript with React and ESLint for consistent code style.
- Ensuring smooth interactions between the extension, backend, and frontend.

## Installation Process
