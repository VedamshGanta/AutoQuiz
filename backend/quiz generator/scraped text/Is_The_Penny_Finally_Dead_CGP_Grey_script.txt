let the joyous news be spread the worthless old penny at last is dead the president said but after two centuries of copper in play can just one order really sweep it away to find out when power is in doubt we turn to the Constitution to sort it out which has Congress right what laws shall be while the president decides how to enforce their decree and since Congress created the pennies through ink the president has no power to snap them away you'd think okay so the president really did just post that the days of printing pennies are now done because printing pennies is dumb it costs more than a penny to print a penny and it has for ages 13 years ago when I first made a video on this topic click here it cost 2 cents to print a penny but since then it's only gotten worse every year nearly 4 cents now which means the government spends $1 to buy 27 a terrible deal one shouldn't do even once but instead that somehow happens 100 million times every year year evaporating $70 million Into The Ether just to print pennies which means yes the US Mint manages to lose money while literally printing money guys like literally how like literally why well the why is cuz Congressional law says to do so or does it which brings us back to the president's post saying sod this it's stupid we're stopping but does the president really have the power to prevent the penny printing cuz according to the Constitution the president president is to execute the laws that congress writes but the thing is Congress blessed their hearts has been having a hard time with their half of the homework see to pass a law means coring hundreds of Congress Critters together to all agree not just on the law they'd like to pass but the exact wording and boring but vital details of that law and that's like really hard to get everyone to agree on cuz laws have gotten way longer and complicated so there's more to argue over not to make mentioned gluing loads of laws together and also it's summer break soon so to get it done and go outside Congress has developed a bit of a bad habit by writing broad laws that state their simple goal X needs to happen and assigning the funds to pay for it but then the exact details of how the x is to be done they often just don't which means there's less to argue over which makes the law easier to pass but passes the problem to the president of how to X exactly and the panic is the perfect example Congress passed the law stating which coins can exist and gave the money to make them but how many coins to Mint that's very hard math so uh just print the necessary amounts K necessary necessary amounts amounts so I decide what is necessary what is amount sure perfect wait what so if the penny costs more to make than it's worth then it seems to me necessarily unnecessary and zero Z is technically an amount correct which technically correct but this trick of zero is something right guys will definitely cause some push back because if it works it means the president has the ability to eliminate anything Congress wasn't crystal clear about in the exact details of its creation so when an inevitable argument starts over who can tell who what to do what then again we take it to the Constitution which tells us to take it to the courts who always have only one question Mr President is their president and in this case of coins well not exactly see previous presidents with unpopular coins they wished to ditch used the same trick but softer instructing the mint to print the necessary amounts needed only for numismatists coin collectors that is which was not a lot and effectively retired those coins from circulation so non-collecting citizens didn't have to deal with coins they didn't like the president got to push presidential power Just A Pinch while Congress didn't feel countermanded everyone was happy especially the coin collectors whose unwanted coins just got rarer but the penny is different unlike those other coins it's used everywhere billions need printing a year at a loss which is the whole problem and what makes it harder to argue that zero is the necessary amount of pennies instead of the presidentially preferred amount of pennies what will happen now we have to wait and see will the president push this trick to its technically correct Max and if so and if it stands it could become the precedent for future presidents for eliminating far more than just coins but until then a hem even a soft technically correct decree will make pennies mostly cease to be saving billions now lost on Copper's high cost thus whichever path lies ahead ding dong the penny is truly dead [Music] [Music]
